# A collection of literature pertaining to the medical and recreational use of psychedelic drugs.

A collection of research into various psychedelics. Mainly focusing on LSD and psilocybin (mushrooms), but also on MDMA (ecstasy), ketamine, DMT, and mescaline/peyote. Psychedelics have been used for centuries, from psilocybin-containing mushrooms to ayahuasca brews containing DMT. But it was not until the 1940's when America, and the rest of western civilization, came into contact with them. The discovery of LSD brought with it the discovery of seratonin, which changed the way we thought about psychology and mental disorders. LSD and psilocybin were used to treat a varity of disorders, from alcoholism to anxiety and depression. The rise of the counterculture, stories of LSD-induced murders and suicides, and societal pressure caused these drugs to be criminalized heavily accross America and most of the rest of the world. Today, we are seeing more and more support for using these substances in a medical setting, and many unlikely treatments for a multitude of disorders and conditions are starting to come to light.
